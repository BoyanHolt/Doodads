## Practice

1. Fork and clone down this respository
1. Open Doodads.pde in Processing.
1. Run the program. You should get an error message that says The field Doodad.myNum is not visible because the client code in setup() is trying to access a private member variable.
1. Fix the program by
   * finishing the two setter and getter functions in Doodad.java 
   * rewriting the client code in setup() to use the two setter and getter functions
1.  The finished program should print Sum is 5.859870195388794
1.  Edit the files in Github to reflect the working version.
